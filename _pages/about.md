Hello! I'm a Computer Science graduate from [HE2B-ESI](https://he2b.be/etudiant/), with a passion for continuous learning and improvement as a developer. I'm always looking for ways to expand my skill set, whether it's through personal projects, keeping up with the latest industry trends, or tackling new challenges. Every day, I strive to grow both personally and professionally.


When I'm not coding or working, I enjoy watching anime and play video games. I'm also an avid reader of light novels, which feed my imagination and offer fresh perspectives. 


Feel free to check out some of my recent personal projects here!
