Hello! I'm a final year Computer Science student at [HE2B-ESI](https://he2b.be/etudiant/), currently interning as a Full Stack Developer at [ETNIC](https://www.etnic.be/). I'm working on building a new project from scratch that uses generative AI. I'm eager to learn and improve my skills as a developer.

Outside of my studies and work, I enjoy watching anime and playing video games. You can check out some of my recent personal projects here!"
